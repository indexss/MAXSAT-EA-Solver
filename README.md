## MaxSAT Problem Solver with Refined Evolutionary Algorithm

A compact personal project for tackling MaxSAT. It focuses on evaluating WCNF clauses and exploring highâ€‘quality assignments through a refined evolutionary algorithm.

### What it does

- Parses WCNF clause data
- Evaluates clause satisfaction under bitstring assignments
- Searches for strong assignments via a refined evolutionary approach

Minimal by design; the implementation serves as the reference.
